PyAxisVM - The official python package of **AxisVM**
====================================================

The **PyAxisVM** project offers a high-level interface to **AxisVM**, 
making its operations available directly from Python. It builds on top of 
Microsoft's COM technology and supports all the features of the original 
**AxisVM** COM type library, making you able to

* build, manipulate and analyse **AxisVM** models

* find better solutions with iterative methods

* combine the power of **AxisVM** with third-party Python libraries

* build extension modules

On top of that, **PyAxisVM** enhances the type library with Python's slicing 
mechanism, context management and more, that enables writing clean, concise, 
and readable code.
